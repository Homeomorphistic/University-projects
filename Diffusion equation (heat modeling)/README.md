## **Heat equation [Python]**

The heat equation is one of many _**partial differential equations**_, yet it is one of the most studied among physicists and mathematicians. It is important in many fields of applied mathematics including probability theory and finacial mathematics. This project focuses on solving this equation on a _**rod (1 dimension)**_ and a _**plate (2 dimensions)**_ and presenting those solutions in _**3D animations**_.
