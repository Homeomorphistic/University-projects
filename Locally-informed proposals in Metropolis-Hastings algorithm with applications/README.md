## **Locally-informed proposals in Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with applications [Python]**

The Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) are a family of algorithms used for approximating sampling from a given probability distribution. They prove very effective when the state space is large. This fact can be used to solve many hard deterministic problems -- one of them being _**traveling salesmen problem**_. It will be used in this thesis to test a new approach of _**locally-informed proposals**_ as a modification of well known _**Metropolis-Hastings algorithm**_.
