## **Monte Carlo methods and simulations [R]**

This project is about simulating stochastic processes and using basic Monte Carlo methods to answer real problems of assembly line production. The projects shows strength of using simulations, instead of long-term gathering of data. The fundamental _**Crude Monte Carlo estimator (CMC)**_ is used extensively to answer questions about minimizing the cost of downtime of machines or the length of a queue in asembly line.
