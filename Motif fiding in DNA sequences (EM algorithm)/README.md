## **Motif finding in DNA sequences [Python/Numpy]**

Motif is a sequance of nucleotide. Given an array of motifs can one recover the probabilities of occurence of nucleotides? What if there are 2 different probability distributions? This project seeks to find answers to those questions using _**Expectation-Maximization algorithm (EM)**_. It is testing it performance on different types of data, which is entirely simulated.
