## **Pseudorandom number generators [Python/Numpy]**

Randomness cannot be created on deterministic machines like computers. So, can we at least get close to real randomness? This project is exploring topic of pseudorandomness by constructing many _**pseudorandom number generators (PRNG)**_ and testing them with statistical methods.
