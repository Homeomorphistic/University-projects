# **University Projects**

The repository consists of projects made by me (or in collaboration with someone mentioned in project). The code is exclusively written by me (with one exeption that is also mentioned). The repository holds only a few of my many projects and it serves a purpose of presenting my skills in fields of programming and mathematics. At the moment, there are 11 projects present, which contain my bachelor thesis and codes in Python, R, SQL (more details below).

## **Motif finding in DNA sequences [Python/Numpy]**

Motif is a sequance of nucleotide. Given an array of motifs can one recover the probabilities of occurence of nucleotides? What if there are 2 different probability distributions? This project seeks to find answers to those questions using _**Expectation-Maximization algorithm (EM)**_. It is testing it performance on different types of data, which is entirely simulated.

## **Pseudorandom number generators [Python/Numpy]**

Randomness cannot be created on deterministic machines like computers. So, can we at least get close to real randomness? This project is exploring topic of pseudorandomness by constructing many _**pseudorandom number generators (PRNG)**_ and testing them with statistical methods.

## **Recommender system [Python/Numpy]**

Recommender system is a subclass of information filtering systems that seek to predict the "rating" or "preference" of a user. This project is based on ratings of movies. Given their past, how will their future ratings look? Answers to this question are provided by testing _**non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)**_ and _**singural-value decomposition (SVD)**_.

## **AB testing [Python/Numpy/Pandas]**

## **Monte Carlo methods and simulations [R]**

This project is about simulating stochastic processes and using basic Monte Carlo methods to answer real problems of assembly line production. The projects shows strength of using simulations, instead of long-term gathering of data. The fundamental _**Crude Monte Carlo estimator (CMC)**_ is used extensively to answer questions about minimizing the cost of downtime of machines or the length of a queue in asembly line.

## **Statistical simulations [R]**

This project is more of a series of labs, that are testing many statistical models by simulations. This project includes testing of: _**information criteria**_ (model selection), regularization methods (_**SLOPE, LASSO, ridge regression**_ and their modifications), _**PCA**_ with _**PESEL**_ procedure.

## **Valuation of portfolios [R]**

Porfolio evaluation is establishing the value of each asset owned by the investment fund or entity. In case of this project the payment of liabilities was evaluated. It was done by constructing _**binary trees, pruned trees**_ and finaly _**random forrests**_. The project included practical side of statistics: _**imputation of missing data**_, rating models with _**Gini index**_ or _**logloss**_ and inferring on various plots like _**partial plot**_.

## **Ski jumping database [PostgreSQL]**

The data on ski jumping competitions provided by FIS proves to be really inaccessible and needs to be reorganized. The aim of this project is to construct basic database to clear up the data and test some database functionalities (_**views, functions, triggers**_).

## **Major league soccer database [MySQL]**

## **Statistical analysis of codon frequency in genetic code [R]**

##  **Old C++ game [C++]**

This project is just a basic point-and-click game, that presents my skills in object oriented programming.
