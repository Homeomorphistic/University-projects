## **Spiral waves [Python]**

The _**reaction-diffusion systems**_ are mathematical models used in many scientific fields (chemistry, physics, biology etc.) to model real world phenomena using _**partial differential equations**_ with _**diffusion**_ (heat). This project examines special case of _**FitzHugh-Nagumo model**_, which is used to model electricity in neurons and tries to introduce instabilities (including _**Turing instability**_) to the system that will create special patterns like _**spiral waves**_.
