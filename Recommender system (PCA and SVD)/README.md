## **Recommender system [Python/Numpy]**

Recommender system is a subclass of information filtering systems that seek to predict the "rating" or "preference" of a user. This project is based on ratings of movies. Given their past, how will their future ratings look? Answers to this question are provided by testing _**non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)**_ and _**singural-value decomposition (SVD)**_.
