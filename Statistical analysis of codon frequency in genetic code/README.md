## **Statistical analysis of codon frequency in genetic code [R]**

The genome is a medium of information in living organisms, the whole growth process and functionality of an organism depends on it. It is build by a triplets of nucleotides, called a _codons_. Are those randomly distributed in a genome? Are there any relations between them? Are we able to use classic statistical methods such as _**Chi squared test**_ or _**Maximum likelihood estimators**_ in a problem with tens of thousands of observations? My bachelor thesis seeks to answer those questions and analyze the tools used in those problems.
